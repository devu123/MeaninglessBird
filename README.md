Music Visualization as Bird

This bird flaps its wings to the beat of whatever song that is playing from the stereo of the computer this is ran in!

Keep any key pressed for the bird to listen to the computer audio stream.

Pulse the key 't' to set the bird's tail to another beat that restarts at the top of the bird's flap.



A music visualization exercise!
